# Case-Management-Data-Analysis
The **Case Management Tracker** is an Excel-based tool designed to help probation officers efficiently manage and monitor their caseloads. It tracks the progress and status of cases, provides insights into case distribution, and officer performance, and helps identify trends over time.


## Dataset used

A synthetic dataset generated by ChatGPT was used to demonstrate the methodology for this analysis. 


## Questions (KPIs)

- How many cases does each probation officer manage?

- How many clients have undergone multiple status changes?

- What is the monthly caseload trend?

## Process

- Verified data for any missing values and anomalies, and sorted out the same.

- Ensured data is consistent and clean for the data type, values, and data format.

- Developed pivot tables according to the questions asked.

- Consolidated all pivot tables into a singular dashboard and applied a data validation list to streamline data entry and ensure consistency for the user.
